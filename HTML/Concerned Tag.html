    <h1>Mathematical Equation</h1>
    <br>
    <p>In mathematics, an equation is a mathematical formula that expresses the equality of two expressions, by connecting them with the equals sign</p>
    <br>
    <p>Mathematics comes with an endless scope of research and study in the domain of numbers and their operations. Every branch of mathematics has something different to deal with. The branches explore new methods and standards of calculation for making daily trade even more convenient. 

        Mathematics is divided into various branches as per the way of calculation involved and the topics covered by them. The branches include geometry, algebra, arithmetic, percentage, exponential, etc. Mathematics also provides standard-derived formulas to make the operations or calculations accurate. The given article provides all the basic formulas present in mathematics under its different branches or fields.
