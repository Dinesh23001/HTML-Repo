    <p>Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. is a Chinese multinational technology corporation headquartered in Shenzhen, Guangdong province. 
    </p>
    <P>Huawei’s strategy has become more refined, as it looks to compete in the premium segment of the smartphone market, rather than across all sectors.

        “Huawei’s smartphones took the second spot in the high-end segment. So we are making a comeback with vengeance,” said Yu.
        
        In the segment of phones priced more than $600 in China, Huawei’s share jumped to 18.4% in the second quarter versus 6.7% in the same period in 2022, according to IDC.</P>
