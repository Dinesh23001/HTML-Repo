    <p>Madras Rubber Factory, commonly known as MRF or MRF Tyres, is an Indian multinational tyre manufacturing company and the largest manufacturer of tyres in India. It is headquartered in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.</p>
    Madras Rubber Factory was started by K. M. Mammen Mappillai as a toy balloon manufacturing unit in 1946 at Tiruvottiyur, Madras (now Chennai). In 1952, the company ventured into the manufacture of tread rubber. Madras Rubber Factory limited was incorporated as a private company in November 1960 and ventured into manufacture of tyres in partnership with Mansfield Tire & Rubber company based in Ohio, United States. The company went public on 1 April 1961 and an office was established in Beirut, Lebanon to develop the export market in 1964 and its current logo of the muscleman was born. In 1967, it became the first Indian company to export tyres to USA.<p></p>

    <p>Due to the all steel radial construction the sidewall of a radial tyre is more flexible compared to a bias tyre resulting in a shorter, but wider footprint. This means less rolling resistance, lower fuel consumption, more grip and greater ride comfort at greater speeds.</p>
