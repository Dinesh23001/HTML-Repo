    <br>
    <p>Wireless headphones are headphones that connect to a device, such as a smartphone, stereo speaker, television, gaming console, computer, or other electronic devices without using a wire or cable.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Headphones are a pair of padded speakers which you wear over your ears in order to listen to a radio or recorded music, or for using a phone without other people hearing it.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Since wireless headphones don't have extra wires and components, they're more portable and lighter. Wireless headphones' compact design makes them great options for active people. The lighter weight also usually affects comfort as lighter headphones typically give less stress on the users' heads.
